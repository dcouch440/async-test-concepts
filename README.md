## Description  
This is a semi functional/ non finalized project made to test api calls, destructuring, async api calls, returning async object values with multiple api call chains in mind. The app makes a call based on user input, calls the first api (open weather), gets the description of the day and grabs a gif from it with the giphy api.

This projects techniques or functionality does not represent me or my coding knowledge.
