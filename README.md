## Description  
This is a semi functional/ non finalized project made to test api calls, destructuring, async api calls, and passing objects from functions with async and multiple api call chains in mine. The app makes a call based on user input, calls the first api (weather), gets the description of the day and grabs a gif for it.

This projects techniques or functionality does not represent me or my coding knowledge.
